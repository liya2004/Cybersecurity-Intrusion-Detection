# Cybersecurity-Intrusion-Detection
ML-based Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System

## Brief Summary
A machine learning–based system that detects malicious network traffic and classifies it as normal or intrusion.

---

## Overview
Cyber attacks and unauthorized access are major threats to modern computer networks.  
This project focuses on building an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using machine learning techniques to identify suspicious or malicious network activities.

The model is trained on network traffic data and integrated with a **Streamlit web application** to provide easy and interactive predictions.

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional security systems often fail to detect new and unknown cyber attacks.  
There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically analyze network traffic and detect intrusions with better accuracy.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains network traffic features
- Includes both **normal** and **attack** traffic records
- Used for training and testing the machine learning model
- Data preprocessing and analysis were performed before model training

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Pickle (for saving the trained model)

---

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation using performance metrics
- Saving the trained model using pickle
- Deploying the model using Streamlit

---

## Key Insights
- Certain network features play a major role in identifying intrusions
- Visualizations helped understand attack patterns
- The trained model is effective in distinguishing normal and malicious traffic

---

## Application Interface and Model Output
The Streamlit web application allows users to:
- Enter network traffic values
- Get real-time predictions
- View results in a simple and user-friendly interface



---

## Result and Conclusion
The intrusion detection system successfully classifies network traffic as normal or malicious.  
The project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively used to improve cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection.

---

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms
- Use larger and real-time datasets
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms
- Add real-time network traffic monitoring
